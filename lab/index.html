                I am Hans-Olov "Loffe" Knutsson. Student at EC Utbildning. At the age of 42 I've
                finally decided what I want to do when I grow up: <strong>I want to be a programmer!
                </strong>For two years from now I will study Java, HTML, CSS and Javascript. This has
                interested me for a long time, but time hasn't been enough... not even as a hobby. So
                now I live my dream!
            </p>
            <p>
                It isn't completely true that this is my first web page. The first one I did was for
                our deathmetal band <strong>Putrefaction</strong> in 1997 (?) or something. Coded in a
                pure text editor on my Amiga. Tables was a new thing that Internet Explorer could handle,
                but not my Amiga browser... I haven't touched HTML since then. Until now.
